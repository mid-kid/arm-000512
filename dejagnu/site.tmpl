# site.tmpl -- Sample template for a global config file.
#           NOTE: This file contains mostly site specific
#                 configuration data that is custom to Cygnus
#                 Support. You'll have to change most of the 
#                 values to work at your site.

#              override how the tool names are calculated.

# uncomment this if you wish to redefine the transform procedure
