Subject: Re[2]: Flex on an AS400

              I have no problem at all with being a contact for advice
          on porting Flex to EBCDIC.  The code was put on an AS400, so
          filing the message under /MISC/AS400 is more appropriate.
          The port was an interesting, very educational experience.
          Thanks again.
