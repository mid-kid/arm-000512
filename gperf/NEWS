New in 2.7:

* gperf is now a stand-alone package, untied from libg++.
* Autoconfiguring.
* Removed the "-a" and "-g" options, extended the "-L" option instead.
* Removed the "-p" option, it is the default.
* Added long options ("--help", "--version" etc.).
* 8-bit cleanliness is now the default; use "-7" to get the old behaviour.
* Compiles with any C++ compiler.
* Numerous small improvements.
