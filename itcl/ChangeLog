	* itcl/unix/configure.in: bracket AC_CACHE_VAL of AC_EGREP_CPP correctly
        * itcl/win/configure.in: Likewise

        * itk/win/configure.in: Likewise

1999-03-19  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

        * itk/win/Makefile.in (install-man): Don't install "*.3", there is
        no man page for section 3.

1999-03-18  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* iwidgets3.0.0/unix/Makefile.in (install-libraries): Don't bother with
	making symlinks for other versions of iwidgets -- we don't use them.	

1999-03-03  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

        * iwidgets3.0.0/generic/labeledframe.itk (_reconfigure): Make sure
        that the widget has not been destroyed while in the update
        idletasks.  FIXME - see if we can eliminate the need for this
        update.

        * iwidgets3.0.0/generic/labeledframe.itk (clientHandlesConfigure):
        Added method to allow the user of the labeled frame to do the
        reconfigure, so this can be batched up and reduce flashing.

1999-02-24  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

        * iwidgets3.0.0/generic/labeledframe.itk: Make it derive from Widget
        not Archetype (which was a BAD idea).  Add an interposing frame so
        you didn't have to much with the highlightthickness of the
        MegaWidget itself.  Doing this allows you to actually use the
        labeledframe in derived classes.
        * iwidgets3.0.0/generic/scrolledwidget.itk: Derive from labeledframe,
        not labeledwidget.  This way you can add a relief around the
        label, which looks better for scrolled text, scrolled listboxes
        and scrolled canvases.
        * iwidgets3.0.0/generic scrolledcanvas.itk, scrolledlistbox.itk,
        scrolledtext.itk: Pushed throught the changes needed to get the
        derivation from labeledframe to work.

1999-03-01  DJ Delorie  <dj@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: cygwin, not cygwin32
	* configure: ditto

1999-01-30  Brendan Kehoe  <brendan@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (install-info info install-check): Add these null
	rules, for the standard build process to work..

1999-01-28  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* itcl/itcl/unix/configure.in: Check the TCL_LIB_VERSIONS_OK
	variable, and strip out dots if it is nodots.
	* itcl/itk/unix/configure.in: Check the TCL_LIB_VERSIONS_OK
	variable, and strip out dots if it is nodots.
	* itcl/itcl/unix/configure: regenerate.
	* itcl/itk/unix/configure: regenerate.	

1999-01-21  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* itcl/library/init.tcl (auto_import): Comment out this function.
	It does not work, because it can not populate the source
	namespace's export list.  There is no easy way to fix this, and
	since it is just an optimization over the original Tcl proc, we
	will just use Tcl one for now.

1999-01-20  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* itcl/library/init.tcl: updated to Itcl 3.0.1.  Does not force
	the addition of class to the auto_mkindex_parser namespace, but
	uses the namespace import instead.

1998-12-15  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/panedwindow.itk: Reverted back to original
	distribution. The new panedwindow widget is now in libgui. 

	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/pane.itk: Reverted.
	
1998-12-11  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/panedwindow.itk: Major changes to
	support panes that are fixed (non-resizable). This allows
 	the panedwindow to be used as a more general purpose
	container widget where individual parts may or may not be
	resizable.
	
	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/pane.itk (iwidgets::Pane): Added
	-resizable option to support non-resizable panes.

1998-12-08  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/panedwindow.itk: Major changes to 
	the default look and resizing method to be more modern, more
	windows-like, and work better when widgets are placed in childsites.
