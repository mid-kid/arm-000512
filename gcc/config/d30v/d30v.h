#define STRICT_ALIGNMENT 1

/* Define this if you wish to imitate the way many other C compilers handle
   alignment of bitfields and the structures that contain them.

   The behavior is that the type written for a bitfield (`int', `short', or
   other integer type) imposes an alignment for the entire structure, as if the
   structure really did contain an ordinary field of that type.  In addition,
   the bitfield is placed within the structure so that it would fit within such
   a field, not crossing a boundary for it.

   Thus, on most machines, a bitfield whose type is written as `int' would not
   cross a four-byte boundary, and would force four-byte alignment for the
   whole structure.  (The alignment used may not be four bytes; it is
   controlled by the other alignment parameters.)

   If the macro is defined, its definition should be a C expression; a nonzero
   value for the expression enables this behavior.

   Note that if this macro is not defined, or its value is zero, some bitfields
   may cross more than one alignment boundary.  The compiler can support such
   references if there are `insv', `extv', and `extzv' insns that can directly
   reference memory.

   The other known way of making bitfields work is to define
   `STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' as large as `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'.  Then every
   structure can be accessed with fullwords.

   Unless the machine has bitfield instructions or you define
   `STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' that way, you must define
   `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' to have a nonzero value.

   If your aim is to make GNU CC use the same conventions for laying out
   bitfields as are used by another compiler, here is how to investigate what
   the other compiler does.  Compile and run this program:

        struct foo1
        {
          char x;
          char :0;
          char y;
        };

        struct foo2
        {
          char x;
          int :0;
          char y;
        };

        main ()
        {
          printf ("Size of foo1 is %d\n",
                  sizeof (struct foo1));
          printf ("Size of foo2 is %d\n",
                  sizeof (struct foo2));
          exit (0);
        }

   If this prints 2 and 5, then the compiler's behavior is what you would get
   from `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS'.

		 : ((GET_MODE_SIZE (MODE) + UNITS_PER_WORD - 1)		\
		    / UNITS_PER_WORD))

/* A C expression that is nonzero if it is permissible to store a value of mode
   MODE in hard register number REGNO (or in several registers starting with
   that one).  For a machine where all registers are equivalent, a suitable
   definition is

        #define HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK(REGNO, MODE) 1

   It is not necessary for this macro to check for the numbers of fixed
   registers, because the allocation mechanism considers them to be always
   occupied.

   On some machines, double-precision values must be kept in even/odd register
   pairs.  The way to implement that is to define this macro to reject odd
   register numbers for such modes.

   The minimum requirement for a mode to be OK in a register is that the
   `movMODE' instruction pattern support moves between the register and any
   other hard register for which the mode is OK; and that moving a value into
   the register and back out not alter it.

   Since the same instruction used to move `SImode' will work for all narrower
   integer modes, it is not necessary on any machine for `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'
   to distinguish between these modes, provided you define patterns `movhi',
   etc., to take advantage of this.  This is useful because of the interaction
   between `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' and `MODES_TIEABLE_P'; it is very desirable for
   all integer modes to be tieable.

   Many machines have special registers for floating point arithmetic.  Often
   people assume that floating point machine modes are allowed only in floating
   point registers.  This is not true.  Any registers that can hold integers
   can safely *hold* a floating point machine mode, whether or not floating
   arithmetic can be done on it in those registers.  Integer move instructions
   can be used to move the values.

   On some machines, though, the converse is true: fixed-point machine modes
   may not go in floating registers.  This is true if the floating registers
   normalize any value stored in them, because storing a non-floating value
   there would garble it.  In this case, `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' should reject
   fixed-point machine modes in floating registers.  But if the floating
   registers do not automatically normalize, if you can store any bit pattern
   in one and retrieve it unchanged without a trap, then any machine mode may
   go in a floating register, so you can define this macro to say so.

   The primary significance of special floating registers is rather that they
   are the registers acceptable in floating point arithmetic instructions.
   However, this is of no concern to `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'.  You handle it by
   writing the proper constraints for those instructions.

   On some machines, the floating registers are especially slow to access, so
   that it is better to store a value in a stack frame than in such a register
   if floating point arithmetic is not being done.  As long as the floating
   registers are not in class `GENERAL_REGS', they will not be used unless some
   pattern's constraint asks for one.  */

/* Many machines have some registers that cannot be copied directly to or from
   memory or even from other types of registers.  An example is the `MQ'
   register, which on most machines, can only be copied to or from general
   registers, but not memory.  Some machines allow copying all registers to and
   from memory, but require a scratch register for stores to some memory
   locations (e.g., those with symbolic address on the RT, and those with
   certain symbolic address on the Sparc when compiling PIC).  In some cases,
   both an intermediate and a scratch register are required.

   You should define these macros to indicate to the reload phase that it may
   need to allocate at least one register for a reload in addition to the
   register to contain the data.  Specifically, if copying X to a register
   CLASS in MODE requires an intermediate register, you should define
   `SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' to return the largest register class all of
   whose registers can be used as intermediate registers or scratch registers.

   If copying a register CLASS in MODE to X requires an intermediate or scratch
   register, `SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' should be defined to return the
   largest register class required.  If the requirements for input and output
   reloads are the same, the macro `SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS' should be used
   instead of defining both macros identically.

   The values returned by these macros are often `GENERAL_REGS'.  Return
   `NO_REGS' if no spare register is needed; i.e., if X can be directly copied
   to or from a register of CLASS in MODE without requiring a scratch register.
   Do not define this macro if it would always return `NO_REGS'.

   If a scratch register is required (either with or without an intermediate
   register), you should define patterns for `reload_inM' or `reload_outM', as
   required (*note Standard Names::..  These patterns, which will normally be
   implemented with a `define_expand', should be similar to the `movM'
   patterns, except that operand 2 is the scratch register.

   Define constraints for the reload register and scratch register that contain
   a single register class.  If the original reload register (whose class is
   CLASS) can meet the constraint given in the pattern, the value returned by
   these macros is used for the class of the scratch register.  Otherwise, two
   additional reload registers are required.  Their classes are obtained from
   the constraints in the insn pattern.

   X might be a pseudo-register or a `subreg' of a pseudo-register, which could
   either be in a hard register or in memory.  Use `true_regnum' to find out;
   it will return -1 if the pseudo is in memory and the hard register number if
   it is in a register.

   These macros should not be used in the case where a particular class of
   registers can only be copied to memory and not to another class of
   registers.  In that case, secondary reload registers are not needed and
   would not be helpful.  Instead, a stack location must be used to perform the
   copy and the `movM' pattern should use memory as a intermediate storage.
   This case often occurs between floating-point and general registers.  */

/* A C expression that should indicate the number of bytes of its own arguments
   that a function pops on returning, or 0 if the function pops no arguments
   and the caller must therefore pop them all after the function returns.

   FUNDECL is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes the
   function in question.  Normally it is a node of type `FUNCTION_DECL' that
   describes the declaration of the function.  From this it is possible to
   obtain the DECL_MACHINE_ATTRIBUTES of the function.

   FUNTYPE is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes the
   function in question.  Normally it is a node of type `FUNCTION_TYPE' that
   describes the data type of the function.  From this it is possible to obtain
   the data types of the value and arguments (if known).

   When a call to a library function is being considered, FUNTYPE will contain
   an identifier node for the library function.  Thus, if you need to
   distinguish among various library functions, you can do so by their names.
   Note that "library function" in this context means a function used to
   perform arithmetic, whose name is known specially in the compiler and was
   not mentioned in the C code being compiled.

   STACK-SIZE is the number of bytes of arguments passed on the stack.  If a
   variable number of bytes is passed, it is zero, and argument popping will
   always be the responsibility of the calling function.

   On the Vax, all functions always pop their arguments, so the definition of
   this macro is STACK-SIZE.  On the 68000, using the standard calling
   convention, no functions pop their arguments, so the value of the macro is
   always 0 in this case.  But an alternative calling convention is available
   in which functions that take a fixed number of arguments pop them but other
   functions (such as `printf') pop nothing (the caller pops all).  When this
   convention is in use, FUNTYPE is examined to determine whether a function
   takes a fixed number of arguments.  */

/* Function Arguments in Registers */

/* A C expression that controls whether a function argument is passed in a
   register, and which register.

   The arguments are CUM, which summarizes all the previous arguments; MODE,
   the machine mode of the argument; TYPE, the data type of the argument as a
   tree node or 0 if that is not known (which happens for C support library
   functions); and NAMED, which is 1 for an ordinary argument and 0 for
   nameless arguments that correspond to `...' in the called function's
   prototype.

   The value of the expression should either be a `reg' RTX for the hard
   register in which to pass the argument, or zero to pass the argument on the
   stack.

   For machines like the Vax and 68000, where normally all arguments are
   pushed, zero suffices as a definition.

   The usual way to make the ANSI library `stdarg.h' work on a machine where
   some arguments are usually passed in registers, is to cause nameless
   arguments to be passed on the stack instead.  This is done by making
   `FUNCTION_ARG' return 0 whenever NAMED is 0.

   You may use the macro `MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)' in the definition of
   this macro to determine if this argument is of a type that must be passed in
   the stack.  If `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is not defined and `FUNCTION_ARG'

/* A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for entry to a

   initializing the frame pointer register, saving registers that must be
   saved, and allocating SIZE additional bytes of storage for the local
   variables.  SIZE is an integer.  FILE is a stdio stream to which the
   assembler code should be output.

   The label for the beginning of the function need not be output by this
   macro.  That has already been done when the macro is run.

   To determine which registers to save, the macro can refer to the array
   `regs_ever_live': element R is nonzero if hard register R is used anywhere
   within the function.  This implies the function prologue should save
   register R, provided it is not one of the call-used registers.
   (`FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must likewise use `regs_ever_live'.)

   On machines that have "register windows", the function entry code does not
   save on the stack the registers that are in the windows, even if they are
   supposed to be preserved by function calls; instead it takes appropriate
   steps to "push" the register stack, if any non-call-used registers are used
   in the function.

   On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the function
   entry code must vary accordingly; it must set up the frame pointer if one is
   wanted, and not otherwise.  To determine whether a frame pointer is in
   wanted, the macro can refer to the variable `frame_pointer_needed'.  The
   variable's value will be 1 at run time in a function that needs a frame
   pointer.  *Note Elimination::.

   The function entry code is responsible for allocating any stack space
   required for the function.  This stack space consists of the regions listed
   below.  In most cases, these regions are allocated in the order listed, with
   the last listed region closest to the top of the stack (the lowest address
   if `STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is defined, and the highest address if it is not
   defined).  You can use a different order for a machine if doing so is more
   convenient or required for compatibility reasons.  Except in cases where
   required by standard or by a debugger, there is no reason why the stack
   layout used by GCC need agree with that used by other compilers for a
   machine.

      * A region of `current_function_pretend_args_size' bytes of
        uninitialized space just underneath the first argument
        arriving on the stack.  (This may not be at the very start of
        the allocated stack region if the calling sequence has pushed
        anything else since pushing the stack arguments.  But
        usually, on such machines, nothing else has been pushed yet,
        because the function prologue itself does all the pushing.)
        This region is used on machines where an argument may be
        passed partly in registers and partly in memory, and, in some
        cases to support the features in `varargs.h' and `stdargs.h'.

      * An area of memory used to save certain registers used by the
        function.  The size of this area, which may also include
        space for such things as the return address and pointers to
        previous stack frames, is machine-specific and usually
        depends on which registers have been used in the function.
        Machines with register windows often do not require a save
        area.

      * A region of at least SIZE bytes, possibly rounded up to an
        allocation boundary, to contain the local variables of the
        function.  On some machines, this region and the save area
        may occur in the opposite order, with the save area closer to
        the top of the stack.

      * Optionally, when `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is defined, a
        region of `current_function_outgoing_args_size' bytes to be

/* #define ELIGIBLE_FOR_EPILOGUE_DELAY(INSN, N) */

/* A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for a thunk function,
   used to implement C++ virtual function calls with multiple inheritance.  The
   thunk acts as a wrapper around a virtual function, adjusting the implicit
   object parameter before handing control off to the real function.

   First, emit code to add the integer DELTA to the location that contains the
   incoming first argument.  Assume that this argument contains a pointer, and
   is the one used to pass the `this' pointer in C++.  This is the incoming
   argument *before* the function prologue, e.g. `%o0' on a sparc.  The
   addition must preserve the values of all other incoming arguments.

   After the addition, emit code to jump to FUNCTION, which is a
   `FUNCTION_DECL'.  This is a direct pure jump, not a call, and does not touch
   the return address.  Hence returning from FUNCTION will return to whoever
   called the current `thunk'.

   The effect must be as if FUNCTION had been called directly with the adjusted
   first argument.  This macro is responsible for emitting all of the code for
   a thunk function; `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' are not
   invoked.

   The THUNK_FNDECL is redundant.  (DELTA and FUNCTION have already been
   extracted from it.)  It might possibly be useful on some targets, but
   probably not.

   If you do not define this macro, the target-independent code in the C++
   frontend will generate a less efficient heavyweight thunk that calls
   FUNCTION instead of jumping to it.  The generic approach does not support
   varargs.  */

        Output code to call the subroutine `__bb_init_func' once per

        you can take a short cut in the definition of this macro and
        use the name that you know will result.

        The first word of this block is a flag which will be nonzero
        if the object module has already been initialized.  So test
        this word first, and do not call `__bb_init_func' if the flag

        may be used to generate a label as a branch destination when
        `__bb_init_func' will not be called.

   this one.  Otherwise it may be too complicated to understand.

   This macro must exist in two variants: a strict variant and a non-strict
   one.  The strict variant is used in the reload pass.  It must be defined so
   that any pseudo-register that has not been allocated a hard register is
   considered a memory reference.  In contexts where some kind of register is
   required, a pseudo-register with no hard register must be rejected.

   The non-strict variant is used in other passes.  It must be defined to
   accept all pseudo-registers in every context where some kind of register is
   required.

   Compiler source files that want to use the strict variant of this macro
   define the macro `REG_OK_STRICT'.  You should use an `#ifdef REG_OK_STRICT'
   conditional to define the strict variant in that case and the non-strict
   variant otherwise.

   Subroutines to check for acceptable registers for various purposes (one for
   base registers, one for index registers, and so on) are typically among the
   subroutines used to define `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS'.  Then only these
   subroutine macros need have two variants; the higher levels of macros may be
   the same whether strict or not.

   Normally, constant addresses which are the sum of a `symbol_ref' and an
   integer are stored inside a `const' RTX to mark them as constant.
   Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums specifically as
   legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply recognize any `const' as
   legitimate.

   Usually `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS' is not prepared to handle constant sums that
   are not marked with `const'.  It assumes that a naked `plus' indicates
   indexing.  If so, then you *must* reject such naked constant sums as
   illegitimate addresses, so that none of them will be given to
   `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS'.

   On some machines, whether a symbolic address is legitimate depends on the
   section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the macro
   `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' to store the information into the `symbol_ref', and
   then check for it here.  When you see a `const', you will have to look
   inside it to find the `symbol_ref' in order to determine the section.  *Note
   Assembler Format::.

   The best way to modify the name string is by adding text to the beginning,
   with suitable punctuation to prevent any ambiguity.  Allocate the new name
   in `saveable_obstack'.  You will have to modify `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' to
   remove and decode the added text and output the name accordingly, and define
   `STRIP_NAME_ENCODING' to access the original name string.

   You can check the information stored here into the `symbol_ref' in the
   definitions of the macros `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS' and
   `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS'.  */

   This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.

   If there are insns that do not set the condition code but do alter other
   machine registers, this macro must check to see whether they invalidate the
   expressions that the condition code is recorded as reflecting.  For example,
   on the 68000, insns that store in address registers do not set the condition
   code, which means that usually `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' can leave `cc_status'
   unaltered for such insns.  But suppose that the previous insn set the
   condition code based on location `a4@(102)' and the current insn stores a
   new value in `a4'.  Although the condition code is not changed by this, it
   will no longer be true that it reflects the contents of `a4@(102)'.
   Therefore, `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' must alter `cc_status' in this case to say
   that nothing is known about the condition code value.

   The RTL structure of these insns is not sufficient to indicate what the
   insns actually do.  What `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' should do when it sees one is
   just to run `CC_STATUS_INIT'.

   A possible definition of `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' is to call a function that looks

/* An expression giving the cost of an addressing mode that contains ADDRESS.
   If not defined, the cost is computed from the ADDRESS expression and the
   `CONST_COSTS' values.

   For most CISC machines, the default cost is a good approximation of the true
   cost of the addressing mode.  However, on RISC machines, all instructions
   normally have the same length and execution time.  Hence all addresses will
   have equal costs.

   In cases where more than one form of an address is known, the form with the
   lowest cost will be used.  If multiple forms have the same, lowest, cost,
   the one that is the most complex will be used.

   For example, suppose an address that is equal to the sum of a register and a
   constant is used twice in the same basic block.  When this macro is not
   defined, the address will be computed in a register and memory references
   will be indirect through that register.  On machines where the cost of the
   addressing mode containing the sum is no higher than that of a simple
   indirect reference, this will produce an additional instruction and possibly
   require an additional register.  Proper specification of this macro
   eliminates this overhead for such machines.

   Similar use of this macro is made in strength reduction of loops.

   ADDRESS need not be valid as an address.  In such a case, the cost is not
   relevant and can be any value; invalid addresses need not be assigned a
   different cost.

   On machines where an address involving more than one register is as cheap as
   an address computation involving only one register, defining `ADDRESS_COST'
   to reflect this can cause two registers to be live over a region of code
   where only one would have been if `ADDRESS_COST' were not defined in that
   manner.  This effect should be considered in the definition of this macro.
   Equivalent costs should probably only be given to addresses with different
   numbers of registers on machines with lots of registers.

   means that in a cross-compiler the representation of floating point numbers
   in the compiled program may be different from that used in the machine doing
   the compilation.

   Because different representation systems may offer different amounts of
   range and precision, the cross compiler cannot safely use the host machine's
   floating point arithmetic.  Therefore, floating point constants must be
   represented in the target machine's format.  This means that the cross
   compiler cannot use `atof' to parse a floating point constant; it must have
   its own special routine to use instead.  Also, constant folding must emulate
   the target machine's arithmetic (or must not be done at all).

   The macros in the following table should be defined only if you are cross
   compiling between different floating point formats.

   Otherwise, don't define them.  Then default definitions will be set up which
   use `double' as the data type, `==' to test for equality, etc.

/* A C expression that is nonzero if on this machine the number of bits

   truncates the count of a shift operation.  On machines that have
   instructions that act on bitfields at variable positions, which may include
   `bit test' instructions, a nonzero `SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' also enables
   deletion of truncations of the values that serve as arguments to bitfield
   instructions.

   If both types of instructions truncate the count (for shifts) and position
   (for bitfield operations), or if no variable-position bitfield instructions
   exist, you should define this macro.

   However, on some machines, such as the 80386 and the 680x0, truncation only

   which `MODES_TIEABLE_P' is 0, suboptimal code can result.  If this is the
   case, making `TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION' return 0 in such cases may improve

#define TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION(OUTPREC, INPREC) 1

/* A C expression describing the value returned by a comparison operator with
   an integral mode and stored by a store-flag instruction (`sCOND') when the
   condition is true.  This description must apply to *all* the `sCOND'
   patterns and all the comparison operators whose results have a `MODE_INT'
   mode.

   A value of 1 or -1 means that the instruction implementing the comparison
   operator returns exactly 1 or -1 when the comparison is true and 0 when the
   comparison is false.  Otherwise, the value indicates which bits of the
   result are guaranteed to be 1 when the comparison is true.  This value is
   interpreted in the mode of the comparison operation, which is given by the
   mode of the first operand in the `sCOND' pattern.  Either the low bit or the
   sign bit of `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' be on.  Presently, only those bits are used
   by the compiler.

   If `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is neither 1 or -1, the compiler will generate code
   that depends only on the specified bits.  It can also replace comparison
   operators with equivalent operations if they cause the required bits to be
   set, even if the remaining bits are undefined.  For example, on a machine
   whose comparison operators return an `SImode' value and where
   `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is defined as `0x80000000', saying that just the sign bit
   is relevant, the expression

        (ne:SI (and:SI X (const_int POWER-OF-2)) (const_int 0))

   can be converted to

        (ashift:SI X (const_int N))

   where N is the appropriate shift count to move the bit being tested into the
   sign bit.

   There is no way to describe a machine that always sets the low-order bit for
   a true value, but does not guarantee the value of any other bits, but we do
   not know of any machine that has such an instruction.  If you are trying to
   port GNU CC to such a machine, include an instruction to perform a
   logical-and of the result with 1 in the pattern for the comparison operators
   and let us know (*note How to Report Bugs: Bug Reporting.).

   Often, a machine will have multiple instructions that obtain a value from a
   comparison (or the condition codes).  Here are rules to guide the choice of
   value for `STORE_FLAG_VALUE', and hence the instructions to be used:

      * Use the shortest sequence that yields a valid definition for
        `STORE_FLAG_VALUE'.  It is more efficient for the compiler to
        "normalize" the value (convert it to, e.g., 1 or 0) than for
        the comparison operators to do so because there may be
        opportunities to combine the normalization with other
        operations.

      * For equal-length sequences, use a value of 1 or -1, with -1
        being slightly preferred on machines with expensive jumps and
        1 preferred on other machines.

      * As a second choice, choose a value of `0x80000001' if
        instructions exist that set both the sign and low-order bits
        but do not define the others.

      * Otherwise, use a value of `0x80000000'.

   Many machines can produce both the value chosen for `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' and
   its negation in the same number of instructions.  On those machines, you
   should also define a pattern for those cases, e.g., one matching

        (set A (neg:M (ne:M B C)))

   Some machines can also perform `and' or `plus' operations on condition code
   values with less instructions than the corresponding `sCOND' insn followed
   by `and' or `plus'.  On those machines, define the appropriate patterns.
   Use the names `incscc' and `decscc', respectively, for the the patterns
   which perform `plus' or `minus' operations on condition code values.  See
   `rs6000.md' for some examples.  The GNU Superoptizer can be used to find
   such instruction sequences on other machines.

   You need not define `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the machine has no store-flag
   instructions.  */
