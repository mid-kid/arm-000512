Mingw32 README for snapshots.

The archive containing this file is a 'snapshot' of current development of
Mingw32.

Mingw32 is a set of header files, import libraries, and other support files
for enabling the GNU compiler, gcc, to use either the C run time library
included with all Win32 operating systems (CRTDLL.DLL) or, optionally, one
of the C run time library DLLs included with Microsoft Visual C++.

Because this is a work in progress some features may be missing or broken,
but I do try to release snapshots that basically work.

The source code and header files that make up Mingw32 (located in the src
and include directories of the archive which contained this file) are in
the PUBLIC DOMAIN.

The Mingw32 package has NO WARRANTY. Use at your own risk.

Further information concerning Mingw32 is available on the World Wide Web
at the following sites:

  http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Towers/6162/gcc.html (in the USA)
  http://www.fu.is.saga-u.ac.jp/~colin/gcc.html (in Japan)

This includes what installation instructions I currently have (which is not
much, I'm working on it).

You can contact me by email at colinpeters@geocities.com. Please include the
word 'Mingw32' in the subject of your email (I get a lot of spam on that
account, do not use a subject like 'hello' or 'remember me?' or I may delete
your mail without reading it).

Have fun,
