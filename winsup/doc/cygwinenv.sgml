<sect1 id="using-cygwinenv"><title>The CYGWIN environment variable</title>

<para>The CYGWIN environment variable is used to configure many global
settings for the Cygwin runtime system. It contains the options listed below.
</para>

<para>Each option should be separated with a space [FIXME: can there
be many spaces?].  Many options can be turned off by prefixing with
"no".
</para>

<para>(no)export - if set, the final values of these settings are
re-exported to the environment as $CYGWIN again.</para>

<para>(no)title - if set, the title bar reflects the name of the
program currently running.  Default is not set.</para>

<para>(no)strip_title - if set, strips the directory part off the
window title.  Default is not set.</para>

<para>Under Win9x the title bar is always enabled and it is stripped
by default.  In order not to strip, specify "title" or "title
nostrip_title".</para>

<para>(no)glob - if set, command line arguments containing UNIX-style
file wildcard characters (brackets, question mark, asterisk) are
expanded into lists of files that match those wildcards.  This is
applicable only to programs running from a Windows command line prompt.
Default is set.</para>

<para>(no)tty - if set, Cygwin enables extra support (i.e., termios) for
UNIX-like ttys.  Defaults to not set. This option must be set before
starting a shell.</para>

<para>(no)binmode - if set, pipes and unspecified file opens default
to binary mode (no CR/LF/Ctrl-Z translations) instead of text mode.
Defaults to not set (text mode). This option must be set before starting
a shell to have an effect of redirection. </para>

<para>strace=n[:cache][,filename] - configures system tracing.  Off by
default, setting various bits in n (a bit flag) enables various types
of system messages.  Setting n to 1 enables most messages.  Other
values can be found in sys/strace.h.  The :cache option
lets you specify how many lines to cache before flushing the output
(example: strace=1:20).  The filename option lets you send the
messages to a file instead of the screen. </para>

<para>(no)ntea - if set, use the full NT Extended Attributes to store
UNIX-like inode information.  Warning: this may create additional
<emphasis>large</emphasis> files on non-NTFS partitions.  This option
only operates under Windows NT. Defaults to not set. </para>

<para>(no)reset_com - if set, serial ports are reset to 9600-8-N-1
with no flow control when used (warning: this is done at open time and
when handles are inherited).  Defaults to set.</para>

<para>(no)envcache - If set, environment variable conversions (between
Win32 and POSIX) are cached.  Note that this is may cause problems if
the mount table changes, as the cache is not invalidated and may
contain values that depend on the previous mount table
contents. Defaults to set.</para>
