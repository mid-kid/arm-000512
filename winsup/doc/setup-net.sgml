<sect1><title>Cygwin Contents</title>

<para>The following packages are included in the full release:</para>

<para>Development tools: binutils, bison, byacc, dejagnu, diff,
expect, flex, gas, gcc, gdb, itcl, ld, libstdc++, make, patch, tcl,
tix, tk</para>

<para>User tools: ash, bash, bzip2, diff, fileutils, findutils, gawk,
grep, gzip, m4, sed, shellutils, tar, textutils, time</para>

<para>The user tools release only contains the user tools.</para>

<para>Full source code is available for these tools. It is split into
these two units.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Installing the binary release:</title>

<para>Important!  Be sure to remove any older versions of the Cygwin
tools from your <literal>PATH</literal> environment variable so you do
not execute them by mistake.</para>

<para>Connect to one of the ftp servers listed above and cd to the
directory containing the latest release. On our primary server, that
would be:</para>

<screen>
ftp://go.cygnus.com/pub/sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/latest/
</screen>

<para>If you want the development tools and the programs necessary to
run the GNU configure mechanism, you should download the full binary
release called <filename>cygwinfull.exe</filename>.  If you only care
about the user tools listed above, download
<filename>cygwinuser.exe</filename> instead.</para>

<para>If you have an unreliable connection, download the appropriate
binary in smaller chunks instead.  For the split full installer, get
the files in the `full-split' subdirectory.  Once downloaded,
combine the split files at the command prompt by doing a:</para>

<screen>
copy /b xaa + xab + xac + ... + xak + xal full.exe
del xa*.*
</screen>

<para>A similar process can be used for the user tools.</para>

<para>Once you have an install executable on your system, run
it.  First off, the installer will prompt you for a location to extract
the temporary files it needs to install the release on your
system. The default should be fine for most people.</para>

<para>Next it will ask you to choose an install location.  The default
is
<filename><replaceable>system-drive</replaceable>:\cygnus\cygwin-b20</filename>.
Feel free to choose another location if you would prefer.</para>

<para>Finally, it will ask you for the name of the Program Files
folder shortcut to add.  By default, the installer will create a
`Cygwin B20' entry in a folder called `Cygnus Solutions'. When this
step is completed, it will install the tools and exit.</para>

<para>At this point, you should be able to look under the start menu
and select "Cygwin Beta 20" (or whatever you named it). This will
pop up a bash shell with all special environment variables set up for
you. If you are running Windows 95 or 98 and are faced with the error
message "Out of environment space", you need to increase the amount of
environment space in your config.sys and try again. Adding the line
<command>shell=C:\command.com /e:4096 /p</command> should do the trick
if <filename>C:</filename> is your system drive letter.</para>

<para>There are two remaining thing you should do from this
prompt. First, you need to type <command>mkdir -p /tmp</command> to
ensure that a directory for temporary files exists for programs that
expect to find one there.</para>

<para>Second, if you are installing the full distribution
(<filename>full.exe</filename>), various programs will need to
be able to find <filename>/bin/sh</filename>.  You should 
<command>mkdir -p /bin</command>' and put a copy of
<filename>sh.exe</filename> there, removing the older version, if
present.  You can use the `mount' utility to select which drive letter
is mounted as <filename>/</filename>.  See the Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) file for more information on `mount'.</para>

<para>If you should ever want to uninstall the tools, you may do so
via the "Add/Remove Programs" control panel.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Installing the source code</title>

<para>Before downloading the source code corresponding to the release,
you should install the latest release of the tools (either the full
release or just the user tools).</para>

<para>Create the directory that will house the source code. `cd'
there.</para>

<para>Connect to one of the ftp servers listed above and cd to the
directory containing the latest release. On our primary server, that
would be:</para>

<screen>
ftp://go.cygnus.com/pub/sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/latest/
</screen>

<para>If you want the user tools source code, `cd' into the
`user-src-split' subdirectory.  Download the files there.  If you want
the development tools sources, `cd' into the `dev-src-split'
subdirectory.  Download the files there.</para>

<para>Back in the Windows command shell, for the user tools
source:</para>

<screen>
copy /b xba + xbb + xbc + xbd + xbe + xbf + xbg user-src.tar.bz2
del xb*.*
bunzip2 user-src.tar.bz2
tar xvf user-src.tar
</screen>

<para>For the development tools source:</para>

<screen>
copy /b xca + xcb + xcc + xcd + ... + xck + xcl dev-src.tar.bz2
del xc*.*
bunzip2 dev-src.tar.bz2
tar xvf dev-src.tar
</screen>

<para>Both will expand into a directory called
<filename>src</filename>.</para>

<para>Note: if you want the sources corresponding to everything in the
full.exe binary installer, you will need to download and expand both
the <filename>user-src.tar.bz2</filename> and
<filename>dev-src.tar.bz2</filename> source archives!</para>
