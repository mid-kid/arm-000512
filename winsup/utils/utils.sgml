<sect1 id="using-utils"><title>Cygwin Utilities</title>

<para>Cygwin comes with a number of command-line utilities that are
used to manage the UNIX emulation portion of the Cygwin environment.
While many of these reflect their UNIX counterparts, each was written
specifically for Cygwin.</para>

<sect2 id="cygcheck"><title>cygcheck</title>

<screen>
Usage: cygcheck [-s] [-v] [-r] [-h] [program ...]
  -s = system information
  -v = verbose output (indented) (for -s or programs)
  -r = registry search (requires -s)
  -h = give help about the info
You must at least give either -s or a program name
</screen>

<para>The <command>cygcheck</command> program is a diagnostic utility
that examines your system and reports the information that is
significant to the proper operation of Cygwin programs.  It can give
information about a specific program (or program) you are trying to
run, general system information, or both.  If you list one or more
programs on the command line, it will diagnose the runtime environment
of that program or programs.  If you specify the <literal>-s</literal>
option, it will give general system information.  If you specify
<literal>-s</literal> and list one or more programs on the command line,
it reports on both.</para>

<para>The <command>cygcheck</command> program should be used to send
information about your system to Cygnus for troubleshooting (if your
support representative requests it).  When asked to run this command,
include all the options plus any commands you are having trouble with,
and save the output so that you can mail it to Cygnus, like
this:</para>

<screen>
<prompt>C:\Cygnus&gt;</prompt> cygcheck -s -v -r -h &gt; tocygnus.txt
</screen>

<para>The <literal>-v</literal> option causes the output to be more
verbose.  What this means is that additional information will be
reported which is usually not interesting, such as the internal
version numbers of DLLs, additional information about recursive DLL
usage, and if a file in one directory in the PATH also occurs in other
directories on the PATH.  </para>

<para>The <literal>-r</literal> option causes
<command>cygcheck</command> to search your registry for information
that is relevent to Cygnus programs.  These registry entries are the
ones that have "Cygnus" in the name.  If you are paranoid about
privacy, you may remove information from this report, but please keep
in mind that doing so makes it harder for Cygnus to diagnose your
problems.</para>

<para>The <literal>-h</literal> option prints additional helpful
messages in the report, at the beginning of each section.  It also
adds table column headings.  While this is useful information, it also
adds some to the size of the report, so if you want a compact report
or if you know what everything is already, just leave this out.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="cygpath"><title>cygpath</title>

<screen>
Usage: cygpath [-p|--path] (-u|--unix)|(-w|--windows) filename
       cygpath [-v|--version]
  -u|--unix     print UNIX form of filename
  -w|--windows  print Windows form of filename
  -p|--path     filename argument is a path
  -v|--version  print program version
</screen>

<para>The <command>cygpath</command> program is a utility that
converts Windows native filenames to Cygwin POSIX-style pathnames and
back.  It can be used when a Cygwin program needs to pass a file name
to a native Windows program, or expects to get a file name from a
native Windows program.  You may use the long or short option names
interchangeably, even though only the short ones are described
here.</para>

<para>The <literal>-u</literal> and <literal>-w</literal> options
indicate whether you want a conversion from Windows to UNIX (POSIX)
format (<literal>-u</literal>) or a conversion from UNIX (POSIX) to
Windows format (<literal>-w</literal>).  You must give exactly
one of these.  To give neither or both is an error.</para>

<para>The <literal>-p</literal> option means that you want to convert
a path-style string rather than a single filename.  For example, the
PATH environment variable is semicolon-delimited in Windows, but
colon-delimited in UNIX.  By giving <literal>-p</literal> you are
instructing <command>cygpath</command> to convert between these
formats.</para>

<example><title>Example cygpath usage</title>
<screen>
#!/bin/sh
for i in `echo *.exe | sed 's/\.exe/cc/'`
do
  notepad `cygpath -w $i`
done
</screen>
</example>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="kill"><title>kill</title>

<screen>
Usage: kill [-sigN] pid1 [pid2 ...]
</screen>

<para>The <command>kill</command> program allows you to send arbitrary
signals to other Cygwin programs.  The usual purpose is to end a
running program from some other window when ^C won't work, but you can
also send program-specified signals such as SIGUSR1 to trigger actions
within the program, like enabling debugging or re-opening log files.
Each program defines the signals they understand.</para>

<para>Note that the "pid" values are the Cygwin pids, not the Windows
pids.  To get a list of running programs and their Cygwin pids, use
the Cygwin <command>ps</command> program.</para>

<para>To send a specific signal, use the
<literal>-signN</literal> option, either
with a signal number or a signal name (minus the "SIG" part), like
these examples:</para>

<example><title>Specifying signals with the kill command</title>
<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> kill 123
<prompt>$</prompt> kill -1 123
<prompt>$</prompt> kill -HUP 123
</screen>
</example>

<para>Here is a list of available signals, their numbers, and some
commentary on them, from the file
<literal>&lt;sys/signal.h&gt;</literal>, which should be considered
the official source of this information.</para>

<sect2 id="mkgroup"><title>mkgroup</title>

<screen>
usage: mkgroup &lt;options&gt; [domain]
This program prints group information to stdout
Options:\n");
    -l,--local           print pseudo group information if there is
                         no domain
    -d,--domain          print global group information from the domain
                         specified (or from the current domain if there is
                         no domain specified)
    -?,--help            print this message
</screen>

<para>The <command>mkgroup</command> program can be used to help
configure your Windows system to be more UNIX-like by creating an
initial <filename>/etc/group</filename> substitute (some commands need this
file) from your system information. It only works on NT.
To initially set up your machine,
you'd do something like this:</para>

<example><title>Setting up the groups file</title>
<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> mkdir /etc
<prompt>$</prompt> mkgroup &gt; /etc/group
</screen>
</example>

<para>Note that this information is static.  If you change the group
information in your system, you'll need to regenerate the group file
for it to have the new information.</para>

<para>The <literal>-d</literal> and <literal>-l</literal> options
allow you to specify where the information comes from, either the
local machine or the default (or given) domain.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="mkpasswd"><title>mkpasswd</title>

<screen>
Usage: mkpasswd [options] [domain]
This program prints a /etc/passwd file to stdout
Options are
   -l,--local              print local accounts
   -d,--domain             print domain accounts (from current domain
                           if no domain specified
   -g,--local-groups       print local group information too
   -?,--help               displays this message
This program does only work on Windows NT

<para>The <command>mkpasswd</command> program can be used to help
configure your Windows system to be more UNIX-like by creating an
initial <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> substitute (some commands
need this file) from your system information. It only works on NT.
To initially set up your machine, you'd do something like this:</para>

<example><title>Setting up the passwd file</title>
<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> mkdir /etc
<prompt>$</prompt> mkpasswd &gt; /etc/passwd

</sect2>

<sect2 id="passwd"><title>passwd</title>

<screen>
Usage passwd [name]
      passwd [-x max] [-n min] [-i inact] [-L len] 
      passwd {-l|-u|-S} name
  -x max   set max age of passwords
  -n min   set min age of passwords
  -i inact disables account after inact days of expiry
  -L len   set min password length
  -l       lock an account
  -u       unlock an account
  -S       show account information
</screen>

<para> <command>passwd</command> changes passwords for user accounts.
A normal user may only change the password for their own account,
the administrators may change the password for any account.
<command>passwd</command> also changes account information, such as
password expiry dates and intervals.</para>

<para>Password Changes: The user is first prompted for their old password,
if one is present.  This password is then encrypted and compared against
the stored password.  The user has only one chance to enter the correct
password.  The administrators are permitted to bypass this step so that
forgotten passwords may be changed.</para>

<para>The user is then prompted for a replacement password.
<command>passwd</command> will prompt again and compare the second entry
against the first.  Both entries are require to match in order for the
password to be changed.</para>

<para>After the password has been entered, password aging information
is checked to see if the user is permitted to change their password
at this time.  If not, <command>passwd</command> refuses to change the
password and exits.</para>

<para>Password expiry and length: The password aging information may be
changed by the administrators with the <literal>-x</literal>, 
<literal>-n</literal> and <literal>-i</literal> options.  The 
<literal>-x</literal> option is used to set the maximum number of days
a password remains valid.  After <emphasis>max</emphasis> days, the
password is required to be changed.  The <literal>-n</literal> option is
used to set the minimum number of days before a password may be changed.  
The user will not be permitted to change the password until
<emphasis>min</emphasis> days have elapsed.  The <literal>-i</literal>
option is used to disable an account after the password has been expired
for a number of days.  After a user account has had an expired password
for <emphasis>inact</emphasis> days, the user may no longer sign on to
the account. Allowed values for the above options are 0 to 999.  The
<literal>-L</literal> option sets the minimum length of allowed passwords
for users, which doesn't belong to the administrators group, to
<emphasis>len</emphasis> characters.  Allowed values for the minimum
password length are 0 to 14.  In any of the above cases, a value of 0
means `no restrictions'.</para>

<para>Account maintenance: User accounts may be locked and unlocked with the 
<literal>-l</literal> and <literal>-u</literal> flags.  The 
<literal>-l</literal> option disables an account.  The <literal>-u</literal>
option re-enables an account.</para>

<para>The account status may be given with the <literal>-S</literal>
option.  The status information is self explanatory.</para>

<para>Limitations: User's may not be able to change their password on
some systems.</para>

<sect2 id="mount"><title>mount</title>

<screen>
Usage mount [-bf] &lt;dospath&gt; &lt;unixpath&gt;
      mount --reset
      mount
  -b   text files are equivalent to binary files (newline = \n)
  -f   force mount, don't warn about missing mount point directories
To reset the mount table use: mount --reset
</screen>

<para>The <command>mount</command> program is used to map your drives
and shares onto the simulated POSIX directory tree, much like as is
done by the POSIX mount command.  This is very similar to the old DOS
<command>join</command>, in that it makes your drive letters appear as
subdirectories somewhere else.  In POSIX operating systems (like
Linux(tm)) there is no concept of "drives" nor drive letters.  All
absolute paths begin with a slash instead of "c:" and all file systems
appear as subdirectories (for example, you might buy a new disk and
make it be the <filename>/disk2</filename> directory).  This practice
is simulated by Cygwin to assist in porting POSIX programs to
Windows.</para>

<para>Normally, you'd just give the DOS/Windows equivalent path and
where you want it to show up in the simulated POSIX tree, like these
examples:</para>

<example><title>Mounting filesystems</title>
<screen>
<prompt>C:\Cygnus&gt;</prompt> mount c:\ /
<prompt>C:\Cygnus&gt;</prompt> mount c:\Cygnus\98r2\bin /bin
<prompt>C:\Cygnus&gt;</prompt> mount d:\ /usr/data
<prompt>C:\Cygnus&gt;</prompt> mount e:\mystuff /mystuff

<prompt>bash$</prompt> mount 'c:\' /
</screen>
</example>

<para>If you just type <command>mount</command> with no parameters, it
will display the current mount table for you.  Using
<literal>--reset</literal> will reset the mount table to its default
set of entries, which may include floppy and tape drives and
such.</para>

<para>Limitations: there is a hard-coded limit of 30 mount
points.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="ps"><title>ps</title>

<screen>
Usage ps [-aefl] [-u uid]
  -f       show process uids, ppids
  -l       show process uids, ppids, pgids, winpids
  -u uid   list processes owned by uid
  -a, -e   show processes of all users
</screen>

<para>The <command>ps</command> program gives the status of all the
Cygwin processes running on the system (ps = "process status").  Due
to the limitations of simulating a POSIX environment under Windows,
there is little information to give.  The PID column is the process ID
you need to give to the <command>kill</command> command.  The WINPID
column is the process ID that's displayed by NT's Task Manager
program.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="umount"><title>umount</title>

<screen>
Usage: unmount &lt;path&gt;
</screen>

<para>The <command>unmount</command> program removes a mount from
the system.  You may specify either the Windows path or the POSIX
path.  See the <command>mount</command> program for information
about the mount table.</para>
