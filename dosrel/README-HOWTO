How to make a dos release:

first build the dos tree, something like:

../devo/configure --target=mips64-elf --host=i386-coff-go32 --build==sun4 --prefix=/b/dosbin
make all info install 

would do nicely

then take the tree in /b/dosbin/dos/mips64-elf and put it on a pc somewhere nice like:

c:\rel\mips64-elf\orig


I do this by tarring the files across.  Then you don't get the odd characters in filenames
which PCNFS sometimes adds.

On the pc run 

relit c:\rel\mips64-elf

It will churn away, work out what to stick on each disk and build some
subdirectories.  This has to be run on the PC for the moment because
we use Microsoft's COMPRESS and EXPAND utilities.

You'll get:

c:\rel\mips64-elf\disk\disk0...


Then run 

diskit c:\rel\mips64-elf b:

and it will prompt you to insert disks and stuff.  It will also erase anything on the floppy
first.
