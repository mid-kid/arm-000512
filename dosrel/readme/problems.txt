To submit a Problem Report, you should fill out this template which is
provided with your distribution (README\SEND-PR.TXT).  You will have to
fill out a small number of fields in the template--type of problem,
urgency, description of how to reproduce it, etc--and then e-mail, or
fax it, to Cygnus Support.  You do NOT need to e-mail it from your PC;
if you have Internet e-mail access on a UNIX workstation, you can just
as easily send the form in from there.

The form should be e-mailed to bugs@cygnus.com or faxed to +1 415 903 0122.
At this time, we are not as efficient with faxed Problem Reports, please
try to use e-mail if at all possible.

When it gets to ``bugs@cygnus.com'', our Problem Report Management
System (PRMS) will automatically assign it to the engineer best able to
help you with whatever problem it may be.  The engineer will work with
you via e-mail and all of the mail related to this Problem Report will
be tracked by PRMS for future reference.  If the engineer does not
reply to you after a certain time, a reminder is automatically
generated.  If you need to talk to someone else in our organization
about the problem (say the engineer dies), we can find out what the
current state is by just the PR number.  Almost all real problems we
handle here at Cygnus Support are dealt with through PRMS.

There is a lot of documentation about PRMS in our supplied
documentation set; please look in the ``Reporting Problems'' section
(it has its own index tab and everything).

Note that the ``Problem Report'' is not only for reporting problems,
it can just as well be used for general questions about using the
Cygnus Developer's Kit.  There is a Class: field which you can set
to ``support'' instead of ``sw-bug''.

Here is a list of the valid PR categories:
