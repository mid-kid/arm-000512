.SH INTRODUCTION
.B unbuffer
disables the output buffering that occurs when program output
is redirected.
For example, suppose you are watching the output from a fifo by running it
through od and then more.  
.nf

	od -c /tmp/fifo | more

.fi
You will not see anything until a full page
of output has been produced.

You can disable this automatic buffering as follows:

.nf

	unbuffer od -c /tmp/fifo | more

.fi
.SH BUGS

The man page is longer than the program.
