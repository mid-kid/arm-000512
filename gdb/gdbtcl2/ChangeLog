1999-09-29  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* prefs.tcl (pref_read): Convert env(HOME) to a win32 path BEFORE
	handing it to file join, so we won't look for a network drive.

1999-08-06  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::ask_thread_bp): Take into account
	the extra BP info.

1999-05-25  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

        * variables.tcl (getLocals): Don't pass any args to gdb_get_{locals, args}
        so that the currently selected frame is used.
        (context_switch): New method.
        * locals.tcl (getVariablesBlankPath): Don't catch call to getLocals.
        getLocals will do it and return {} if an error occurs.
        Always pass the frame of the variable to the variable backend,
        assuming that the selected frame is the proper frame to use.
        (update): Recognize context switches a little better.

        * variables.tcl (cursor): New method.
        (enable_ui): Use "cursor".
        (disable_ui): Ditto.
        (no_inferior): Ditto.
        (open): Change toplevel's cursor when opening variables.

1999-05-03  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

        * toolbar.tcl (create_help_menu): Open About window as transient.

        * about.tcl (About): Set window title.

1999-04-22  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

        * targetselection.itb (port_list): ManagedWin has a proc named
        "open". We really want the tcl command "::open" to open a port.

1999-04-21  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

        * targetselection.itb (_init_db): Add 19200 and 57600 to
        remote baud rates.

1999-04-06  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

        * targetselection.itb (TargetSelection::getname): Call init_target_db.
        (TargetSelection::init_target_db): Add target mon2000. Set
        most remote targets to default to downloading. Add new
        baudrates for remote target. Other misc target fixes.
        (save) Use "pref setd" in case pref is not created yet.
        (TargetSelection::config_dialog): Gray out port number when
        in exec mode.

        * targetselection.ith: Add public proc init_target_db.

1999-04-02  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

        * tclIndex: Rebuilt.
        * toolbar.tcl (create_control_buttons): Use SrcWin's
        inferior method to centralize control of inferior state.
        (create_control_buttons): Ditto.
        (source): Move SrcBar's public variable "source" here,
        so that the toolbar can use that info, too.
        * srcwin.itb (SrcWin::inferior): New public method
        to consildate inferior control and dispatch to proper
        handlers.
        * srcwin.ith (SrcWin::inferior): Add declaration.
        * srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::do_key): Use parent SrcWin's inferior
        method to handle inferior state changes (run, step, next, etc).
        * interface.tcl: Add procs to centralize inferior control:
        gdbtk_step, gdbtk_next, gdbtk_stepi, gdbtk_nexti, gdbtk_run,
        gdbtk_continue, gdbtk_finish, gdbtk_stop.
        New stop button code (see comments before gdbtk_stop):
        (gdbtk_stop_idle_callback): Idle callback for stop button.
        (gdbtk_detach): New proc to forcibly detach from target.
        * main.tcl: Initialize data used by stop button.
        * srcbar.tcl (create_run_menu): Call SrcWin's inferior
        method with button commands.
        (source): Move "source" to Toolbar class.

1999-03-19  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

        * download.itb (Download::download_it): Configure SrcWin's toolbar,
        too, to a downloading state.
        * srcbar.tcl (runstop): Change states from numbers to
        strings to avoid confusion.
        (_set_runstop): Change states from numbers to strings to
        avoid confusion.
        * srcwin.ith (toolbar): New public method.
        * srcwin.itb: Change all references of runstop to use new strings
        introduced into GDBSrcBar::_set_runstop.
        (SrcWin::toolbar): New public method to configure the state of the toolbar.

1999-04-12  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

        * variables.tcl (populate): Update the value of the parent variable's
        children before stuffing them into the window. This makes sure
        that the value of the variable is always current.

1999-04-02  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* memwin.itb (MemWin::build_win): Remove the -validate option from 
	the memory spinner.  It was not appropriate, since you can type
	expressions into the window.

1999-03-13  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* browserwin.itb (BrowserWin::search): If all the files are
	selected in the file box, then don't pass the files argument.
	This makes the function browser a little quicker.  The main
	slowdown, however, is sorting the resultant list.  Maybe do this
	in C to get this quicker?

	* memwin.itb (MemWin::edit): Comment out the line that reads back
	in the newly set memory value.  Because of the chain of calls,
	on Windows this causes some evil race that results in GDBTk
	filling all the visible cells with the new value.  I don't
	understand it yet, so this is just a temporary fix.

1999-03-12  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* memwin.ith (MemWin): Add saved_addr to the class.  This is where 
	we store the old address before we change addresses, so that we
	can get back to a good state in case of errors.

	* memwin.itb (MemWin::update_addr): gdb_get_mem does not always
	return an error code when it hits an error.  Catch that here.
	(MemWin::update_address): Store away the old address, so we can
	restore it if there is an error.
	(MemWin::BadExpr): Restore the saved address in case of errors.
	
1999-03-08  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::constructor): pc(funcname) was
	changed to pc(func), but the initialization was not changed...

	* download.ith (dont_remember_size): Download window should not
	remember its size.

	* debugwin.itb (DebugWinDOpts::build_win): Replace $this delete
	with delete object $this.
	* tfind_args.tcl (build_win): Ditto...
	* helpviewer.itb (HtmlViewer::_buildwin): Ditto...	

1999-04-09  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* memwin.itb (MemWin::incr_addr): Fix the increment-decrement
	control.  It would allow you to scroll into negative addresses,
	which causes some simulators to crash.  It would also increment
	improperly in cases where the address value in hex corresponded to 
	a negative signed int.

1999-03-18  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

        * prefs.tcl (pref_read): Change unix preference filename
        to ".gdbtkinit". This bogosity has been around long enough.

1999-03-29  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* browserwin.itb (BrowserWin::do_all_bp): Fix quoting of break
	command.
	(BrowserWin::_toggle_bp): Ditto.

1999-03-18  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

        * interface.tcl (set_target_name): Remove first argument.
        If prompt is not set, still update gdb_target_cmd.
        (set_target): Call set_target_name with prompt argument
        set correctly.
        (run_executable): Check for no exe name. Catch problems
        with bad target names and prompt for new one.

1999-03-10  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* tclIndex: Rebuild.

1999-03-03  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

        * targetselction.itb (TargetSelection::save): If the target
        is not valid, tell the user rather than simple refusing to go
        away.
        Also move stuff around to isolate the instance dependant stuff as
        much as possible
        Also replace delete with unpost.

        * targetselection.ith (TargetSelection): Make as much of the
        initialization stuff Class functions as possible.  Then only
        initialize it once.

Thu Feb  4 11:55:43 1999  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* targetselection.itb (_init_db): Add MIPS target.
	(fill_targets): Ditto.

Thu Feb  4 07:56:12 1999  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* targetselection.itb: Set "TargetSelection::target_trace"
	as the correct trace for gdb_loaded.
	* targetselection.ith: Make "target_trace" a public proc.

1999-02-03  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* help/console.html: Cleaned up and added history and editing 
	commands.

	* stackwin.itb (StackWin::build_win): Remove balloon help.

	* console.itb (Console::_search_history): New function.
	Does a pattern match on history buffer.
	(Console::_rsearch_history): New function. Does a pattern
	match on history buffer in the reverse direction.
	(Console::_build_win): Bind Control-Up, Control-Down,
	Shift-Up, and Shift-Down to search history instead of mess
	up the console window. Bind Control-o to break to disable it.

	* help/stack.html: Cleanup.

	* help/source.html: Add a bunch of missing quotation marks.

1999-02-03  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>
	
	* memwin.itb: Change from tixControl widget to iwidgets::spinint.
	Fix problems with error dialogs.

1999-02-02  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::do_source_popup): Even after fixing the
	obvious syntax errors in this function, it didn't work. So I
	simplified the logic. Now it will attempt to use whatever is selected.
	If multiple lines are selected and tracing is enabled, it will set
	tracepoints, otherwise it will try to extract a variable name from single
	lines only.

	* main.tcl: Only open debugwin if GDBTK_DEBUG > 1.

	* toolbar.tcl (create_view_menu): Only add "Debug WIndow" menu
	item if GDBTK_DEBUG is set.

	a list.

1999-02-01  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>	

	* srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::FillMixed): Simplify line formatting.
	(SrcTextWin::continue_to_here): Call gdb_set_bp with new type arg.
	(SrcTextWin::set_bp_at_line): Call gdb_set_bp with new type arg.
	Use "catch" command and display error if there is one.

1999-02-01  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>
	
	* srcwin.itb (SrcWin::goto_func): Dont attach filename if
        there isn't a valid one.

	
1999-01-28  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

        * srcwin.itb (SrcWin::_build_win): Only call gdb_loc once.
        (SrcWin::location): Update linespec for gdb_loc to include
        the "lib" arg.

        * srctextwin.itb (SrcTextWin::LoadFromCache): Add "lib"
        argument. This is used to create a unique cache key so
        we don't confuse the disassembly of a function in a shared
        lib with the disassembly of its trampoline. Also updated 
        UnLoadFromCache, LoadFIle, FillSource, FillMixed, and FillAssembly
        to pass this argument around.

        * helpviewer.ith (HtmlViewer::constructor): Declare we have a 
        constructor.
        (PageStack::constructor): Delete this declaration.
        
        * helpviewer.itb (HtmlViewer::constructor): initialize args before 
        calling _buildwin
        
        * main.tcl: Only open initial debug window if GDBTK_DEBUG
        is set.
        
        * help/debug.html: Add help for GDBTK_DEBUG

Wed Jan 27 07:18:05 1999  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

        * interface.tcl (gdbtk_pc_changed): Removed.
        (gdbtk_register_changed): New procedure.
        (gdbtk_memory_changed): New procedure.

Mon Dec 21 14:12:14 1998  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* manage.tcl (manage_create): Set window geometry after window is
	created.

	* prefs.tcl (pref_save): Save out preferences for memory window, too.

Thu Dec 17 08:54:37 1998  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

        * browser.tcl (fill_source): Strip off any function args
        which could arise from C++ function names.
        (search): Be careful of C++ functions with spaces in the name
        returned from gdb_search.

	* prefs.tcl (escape_value, unescape_value): New procs to
	escape equal signs in preference values.

Tue Dec 15 11:07:01 1998  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>
 
        * process.tcl (build_win): Do not export the listbox's selection
        as the X selection so that multiple listboxes can have selections
        highlighted at the same time.
 
        * stack.tcl (build_win): Ditto.
 
Mon Dec 14 15:53:38 1998  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>
 
        * watch.tcl (update): Catch errors to getLocals, which could error
        if no symbol table is loaded.
 
        * locals.tcl (update): Ditto.
 
1998-11-13  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.tcl (bp): Pass "asm" argument to do_bp.
	(do_bp): Use asm argument to determine whether to
	check for multiple bps on the same src line. Remove
	redundant "if" statement.

1998-11-12  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.tcl (do_bp): Fix multiple assembly
	breakpoints mapping to the same line number.

Thu Nov 12 15:20:15 1998  Jim Ingham   <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* console.tcl (complete): I added the ability to pass from_tty 
        from gdb_cmd to the underlying commands.  Pass 1 when the
	command is invoked from the console.

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_tstart, gdbtk_tcl_tstop): Run the
	src window's do_tstop method rather than manipulating the 
	widgets by hand.

	* src.tcl (build_win): Redo the packing so that the function
	combobox doesn't push all the other combo-boxes off the screen
	if it has a very long function name in it.

	* srcbar.tcl (do_tstop): Added a mode that just changes the
	GUI, which can be called from console hooks.

	* srctextwin.tcl: Fixed some bugs I introduced in setting
	breakpoints in the assembly & mixed mode windows.  Dropped
	the notion of joint breakpoint images for lines that have 
	breakpoints of two separate types.  Too fragile.
        Also added the "dont_change_appearance" flag, used in the
	continue_to_here method to tell the GUI not to reflect the
	temporary disabling of all the breakpoints.
	
	* toolbar.tcl (insert_buttons): Added a little more error-checking.


Mon Nov  9 12:09:48 1998  Michael Snyder  <msnyder@cleaver.cygnus.com>

        * actiondlg.tcl: Customize the stack collect string to collect
        the FP reg plus 64 words of stack mem.  This will work for many
        targets.  As noted in earlier comment, we need a way to configure
        this to the specific target.

Wed Nov  4 12:41:42 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* actiondlg.tcl: Get the stack collect string from an instance 
	variable.  Need to implement some way to get this from the
	target settings...
	* global_pref.tcl (toggle_tracing_mode): Add & remove hooks
	when you go in and out of tracing mode.  Also reset the B1
	behavior when you leave tracing mode

	command is used to enter & leave browse mode.
	* srcbar.tcl (constructor, destructor trace_find_hook): Added
	the trace_find_hook to the source toolbar, and added the
	necessary hooks to handle it.
	* srctextwin.tcl (trace_find_hook): Added a trace find hook to 
	the sourcebar as well.
	* stack.tcl (update): protect against errors in gdb_stack.
	Just return "NO STACK" if we couldn't get it.
	* src_pref.tcl (constructor, cancel): Put all the saved prefs
	in an array, on cancel, see if any have changed and only
	rebuild the window if there have been changes.

1998-11-03  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* target.tcl: Add ice target.
	(GdbLoadPref): Add "after_attaching" preference.
	(set_saved): Add "after_attaching" preference.
	(write_saved): Add "after_attaching" preference.
	(change_target): Add "after_attaching" preference.
	(build_win): Add "after_attaching" entry to options
	frame.

	* main.tcl (set_target_name): Add ice target.
	(set_target): If an "after_attaching" preference exists,
	run it.
	
Mon Nov  2 13:24:10 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* bp.tcl (update): The hook function was passing more
	arguments than this function expected.

Mon Nov  2 11:16:10 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* toolbar.tcl: Added Tdump image.	

Fri Oct 30 17:36:05 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* src.tcl (set_execution_status): Changed status messages,
	tracing is not the same as async debugging...

Fri Oct 30 17:06:31 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* bp.tcl (bp_all): Only remove tracepoints in the tracepoint
	window, and breakpoints in the breakpoint window.
	
Fri Oct 30 11:22:23 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* actiondlg.tcl: Added special tag "Collect Stack".  This
	still needs to get hooked into the target database to deal
	with targets that need to do something special to collect the
	stack.  Also moved some repeated code into loops.
	* main.tcl (source_file): Source in a file of gdb commands.
	* srcbar.tcl (constructor): Added source file menu entry, and
	made stack buttons belong to both the Trace & Control classes.
	* srctextwin.tcl (constructor): One too many separators in the 
	trace trace popup menu.
	* tclIndex: regenerated.
	* tfind_args.tcl: Added "tfind frame"
	* toolbar.tcl (create_button): Allow a button to belong to
	more than one class.

	a button to belong to more than one class.
	* toolbar.tcl (create_trace_menu): Added save tracepoints &
	Tfind frame menu items.
	* tracedlg.tcl: Added deletion of actions, and fixed a
	the whiile-stepping combobox callback for the new combobox.
	* util.tcl (save_trace_commands): new proc. 
	 
1998-10-29  Michael Snyder  <msnyder@demo-laptop2.cygnus.com>

	* target.tcl: add /dev/cua0 for Linux.

Tue Oct 27 13:46:03 1998  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* Many little bug fixes all over in order to get tracing to work 
        along with normal program control.
	* toolbar.tcl: Rewrote much of the code here to put commonly
	used code into functions, and clean up adding menus and
	buttons.  Added the ability to disable particular menu items,
	not just whole menus.  Added the ability to delete and insert
	buttons on the fly.
	* srcbar.tcl: Pushed the changes to toolbar.tcl into this file.
	* srctextwin.tcl: Changed the code dealing with breakpoints
	and tracepoints to use the text tags more consistently.  Use
	only one set of menus for the whole widget, rather than having
	a separate set for the SRC+ASM case.  Rewrote a lot of the
	code to separate out the tracing & program control functions.
	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_breakpoint): pass more information
	to the scrtextwin when a breakpoint changes state, so it can
	do the right thing without having to guess...
	* tracedlg.tcl (build_win): get the packing right so the
	window expands correctly.
	* main.tcl: do_tstop -> tstop,  do_tstart -> tstart to avoid
	confusion with the methods in ScrBar.tcl.
	* prefs.tcl: Added two new preferences B1_Behavior to control
	whether B1 sets breakpoints or tracepoints.
	* src_prefs.tcl: Put in support for the B1_Behavior.
        * global_prefs.tcl: Put back tracing checkbox.
        * tdump.tcl: Fixed an incorrect (1 rather than 1.0) text
	widget line specification.
	* tfind_args.tcl (build_win): Bind return in the entry to the
	OK button.  Clear the entry field if the Type has changed. 
	* utils.tcl: Added comments for the debug commands.
	* watch.tcl (build_win): Flash the OK button before invoking it.

Wed Oct 28 16:19:57 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.tcl: Changed the _map cache to use
        the variable Cname instead of the kludgy upvar alias.

	* srctextwin.tcl (motion): Show breakpoint balloons
	even when not running.

	(build_win): Add user-defined list of functions for
	initial breakpoints.
     
	* main.tcl (run_executable): Set user-defined initial
	breakpoints.

	* prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): Define new prefs 
	gdb/load/bp_at_func and gdb/load/bp_func. These are
	user-defined initial breakpoints.
	
Sat Oct 10 00:21:44 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* help/source.html: Add new images, add description of changes
	to breakpoints and threads support.  Fix typos.

	* help/memory.html: Cleanup and add new information.

	* help/breakpoint.html: Reformat.
	
	* help/images: Add a bunch of new GIFs.

1998-10-08  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* main.tcl (run_executable): Do not call set_exe here, either.
        (_open_file): Add some comments about using set_exe
        here instead of in download_it and run_executable. Do not look
        for main, either, since the file hooks will take care of that.

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_pre_add_symbol): Do not reset the
        source windows here -- only show the user what is going on.
        (gdbtk_tcl_post_add_symbol): Force the source windows' file
        comboboxes to refill, since adding a symbol file may actually
        expand the debugger's view of the world.
        (gdbtk_tcl_file_changed): New hook proc. Called by file_changed_hook
        in symfile.c, this hook will cause the source window to point
        to main/entry. gdbtk_tcl_exec_file_display actually sets up
        gdbtk for this.
        (gdbtk_tcl_exec_file_display): Renamed from
        gdbtk_tcl_exec_file_changed for clarity. This hook is called
        from exec_file_display_hook in exec_file_command. This function
        sets up gdbtk to use a new executable, including resetting the
        debugger's state and source window(s). See comments in this file
        for more information.

	* download.tcl (download_it): Don't call set_exe here and
        do not touch state variables gdb_target_changed -- run_executable
        will do it. (In short, make download_it one step closer to only
        doing the download!)

1998-10-08  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* variables.tcl (UnEdit): Fix quoting problems so that arrays may be
        inspected/edited.

	* manage.tcl (manage_create): Bind ALL source windows
	Map and Unmap events.
	(manage_delete): Small optimization.
	(manage_iconify): When the last source window is iconified,
	iconify all the support windows too.  When any source
	window is deiconified, deiconify everything.

	* src.tcl (destructor): Destroy SrcTextWin too. 

Tue Oct  6 23:00:08 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* src.tcl (set_status): Display only the first line of
	the message.
	(build_win): Configure status window to a height of 1.

	* srcbar.tcl (create_menu_items): Change "Open..."
	menu item to call _open_file proc. Remove old
	_open_file method.

	* main.tcl (run_executable): If the run command fails
	with a result of "No executable" then call _open_file.
	(_open_file): New proc. Opens a file requester and

	and Global prefs menu item.

Mon Oct  5 21:10:30 1998 Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.tcl (set_tracepoint):  The filename variable 
	changed to current(filename) but this use was not updated.

	* global_prefs: Added a global preference to turn on the 
	tracing.  It only sets the tracing preference, and does
	not cause gdb to relayout the toolbar yet...

	* util.tcl: Fixed the comments for the little debug
	thingie.

	* util.tcl (auto_step): Added a way to cancel the
	auto_stepping.  This is not currently used, but with this
	it could be...

	* srctextwin.tcl (SrcTextWin): Create a threaded image
	with a color of [pref get gdb/src/thread_fg].
	(bind_src_tags): Bind bp_tag <Motion> and <Leave> for
	balloon help on breakpoints.
	(config_win): A bunch of binding changes to support
	balloon help breakpoints and setting multiple BPs
	on a line. Add menu item for thread specific BPs.
	(reconfig): Similar changes as above.
	(register_balloon): Remove.
	(updateBalloon): Cleanup and don't call register_balloon.
	(do_bp): When a BP is deleted, call gdb_find_bp_at_line()
	to see if there are any more BPs at the same line number.
	Add "thread" BP type.
	(bp_line): Accept an optional list of thread numbers to 
	set BPs on. Loop through the list setting BPs on each thread.
	(motion): Accept a window and type argument. Call 
	showBPBalloon in type is not "var".
	(showBPBalloon): New method.Opens a balloon with breakpoint
	info in it.
	(showballoon): Accept window parameter.
	(ask_thread_bp): New. A thread selector dialog. Opens
	a scrolled listbox with a list of threads and allows
	the user to multiselect threads to set BPs on.
	(do_thread_bp): New callback from ask_thread_bp()
	listbox.

	* src_pref.tcl: Replace disabled color selector with thread
	fg selector.  Disabled color should probably always be
	black anyways.

	* util.tcl (CygScrolledListbox): Temporary simple scrolled
	listbox. Replace with a better one soon.

	* prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): Set default for thread fg.

	* bp.tcl (bp_add): For thread BPs, set the button color
	correctly.

	* tclIndex: Rebuilt.

Fri Oct  2 17:07:32 1998   Jim Ingham   <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* util.tcl (debug namespace): Added helper functions
	"trace_var", "remove_trace" & "remove_all_traces" which
	watch a variable, and dump the stack, and its value when
	it is touched...  They are in the "debug" namespace.
	*tclIndex: regenerate index.

Fri Oct  2 14:02:25 1998   Jim Ingham   <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* main.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_preloop): Catch the error when no file
	is given on the command line.

1998-10-02  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* srcbar.tcl (_open_file): Call SrcWin::point_to_main.
	(_set_runstop): Catch the stop in case the user
	aborts a session.

	* srctextwin.tcl (destructor): New. Remove all previously added
	hooks.
	
	* src.tcl (point_to_main): New function. I got tired of typing
	the same five lines over and over again.

	* main.tcl (set_baud): Target baud preferences are stored as 
	[target name]-baud, not [target name]/baud.
	(run_executable): Call SrcWin::point_to_main.
	(gdbtk_tcl_preloop): Call SrcWin::point_to_main.

	* interface.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_pre_add_symbol): Use "update idletasks", not
	just "update".
	(gdbtk_tcl_post_add_symbol): Rewrite to have better behavior
	for symbol files which have been loaded. Use a small hack to work
	with gdbtk_tcl_exec_file_changed so that we look for main only
	when a new executable is loaded.
	(gdbtk_tcl_exec_file_changed): New proc to do some necessary
	setup when an exec file changes.

	* tclIndex: Regenerate.

Fri Oct  2 11:40:05 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile (TCL): Add modal.tcl.

	* tclIndex: Rebuilt.

1998-10-02  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* srcbar.tcl (_set_runstop): Catch the stop in case the user
	aborts a session.

Thu Oct  1 18:58:11 1998 Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* main.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_preloop): We were using lindex on the
	return value from info files, but if the directory had a space
	in it, then the result was not a proper Tcl list, and so the
	command would fail.  Use regexp instead...	

Thu Oct  1 17:21:26 1998 Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* download.tcl (download_it): One more place where we used
	"Foundry_Debugger" unconditionally...  Stamped out.

	* main.tcl (set_target): Don't put the "Trying to
	communicate..." message in the window title, put it in the
	status area, and remember to remove it when you are done.

Wed Sep 30 21:32:39 1998 Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.tcl (insertBreakTag): There was a bug in the
        method of inserting break tags.  If a tag of the intended
        type did not already exist, insertBreakTag would not set it.
	This method is a little less flexible, but actually works 
	for all our uses.

Wed Sep 30 19:42:43 1998 Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* src.tcl (set_execution_status): When the program has
        terminated, most stubs detach.  Then we need to set 
        gdb_target_changed here so gdb will know to reattack when
        you press the Run button.

	* memory.tcl (update_address): We caught the gdb_eval when you 
	give an address expression, but then only trapped the case
	where you gave an invalid address or non-existant symbol.
	Trap all the other errors as well...

Wed Sep 30 16:55:53 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* bp.tcl: Add optional "thread" column and menu items
	to turn it on and off.

	* prefs.tcl (pref_set_defaults): Add gdb/bp/show_threads
	preference used for toggling the display of the thread
	column in the BP window.  Default is 0 (off).
	
1998-09-28  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* download.tcl (download_it): Don't download if there is no executable...

Mon Sep 28 14:23:39 1998   Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* modal.tcl: NEW FILE.  Had to fix a bug in the dialogs
        so I made a sub-class: ModalDialog.  The bug was that
	manage.tcl sets the WM_DELETE_WINDOW handler to be
	"manage delete" of the window, which is wrong for these
	windows, they need to unpost themselves first.  Override
	this in the post method.
	* mem_pref.tcl: Subclass & remove the code that went into
	the ModalDialog class.
	* target.tcl: ditto.
        * tclIndex: regenerate for the new class.

Fri Sep 25 19:01:32 1998   Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* utils.tcl (freeze): Hacked the freeze method so that it comes closer
        to working on Windows, but it still flashes.  Use a post
	method, like that im mem_prefs.tcl or target.tcl instead.
        * mem_pref.tcl (post): Added post method, so you can use the
	Windows EnableWindow call without sending your app into the
	background when the dialog is dismissed.
        * target.tcl (post): Added the same method to this class.
	Really should subclass these.  Will do this when we rework the 
	class hierarchy for Itcl3.0.
	* memory.tcl (create_prefs): Use the new post method. 
	* main.tcl (set_target_name): Use the post method rather than
	freeze.

1998-09-25  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>
        * main.tcl (set_baud): Baud rates are saved in gdb/load/target-baud,
        not gdb/load/target/baud.

        * target.tcl: Add gdb_target entries for Angel and ARM Remote
        protocols.

1998-09-18  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* srctextwin.tcl (SrcTextWin::destructor): Define and remove
	previously installed hooks.

	item in the listbox.

Thu Sep  3 16:43:43 1998  Jim Ingham   <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* mem_prefs.tcl: Fixed the size & format radiogroups in 
	the memory preferences so that they match the format
	options being sent to it by the memory window.  Also 
	greyed out the format box when float or double is selected.
	Also made sure we didn't re-enable any disabled widgets in 
	the idle function.

Thu Aug 27 14:13:09 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* main.tcl (run_executable): If the target is "sim"

	it looks better.
	
Tue Aug 25 16:09:02 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

1998-08-18  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* stack.tcl (update): Use new built-in command gdb_stack for
	backtraces.
	Use the global gdb_selected_frame_level to figure out which
	line in the listbox should be highlighted.
	ALWAYS highlight the selected frame.

Mon Jul  6 17:53:50 1998  Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* download.tcl, helpViewer.tcl, html_library.tcl, memory.tcl,
        register.tcl, src.tcl, srctextwin.tcl, target.tcl,
	tracedlg.tcl, util.tcl, variables.tcl, warning.tcl, watch.tcl:
	With the Tcl 8.0 compiler, expr commands are more efficient if 
	you use:
	    expr {$foo + $bar}
        instead of:
	    expr $foo + $bar
        So I changed all the uses of expr to this form.

        error in loading an executible specified on the command line,
	then the pre_add_symbol hook would have called gdbtk_busy but
        the corresponding call to gdbtk_idle would not have occured.

        Also changed some catch calls so they didn't use 
        "catch {set foo [real_command]}" 
	    but rather the more efficient: 
	"catch {real_command} foo"
        
	* register.tcl: more catch cleanups

        Wed Mar 25 14:22:28 1998  Keith Seitz  <keiths@onions.cygnus.com>

	* register.tcl (reconfig): Call busy and idle hooks.

	Tue Mar 24 21:03:01 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* src.tcl (location): If gdb_listfuncs returns an error, display
	an error message that says the file was either not found or contained
	no debugging information.
	(location): When disassembling, put busy and idle calls before
	and after. Set "NoRun" to indicate the busy hook should not
	display the stop sign because the target isn't running, GDB may
	just take a few seconds to do the disassembly.
	(busy): Hack to support NoRun mode.

	* srcbar.tcl (_set_runstop): Add another case to disable the
	Run icon instead of changing it to a stop sign.

	* main.tcl (set_exe): If the file has no debugging information,
	display an error message and exit.  This should only happen with
	intentionally stripped files.

	window. Then call idle and the idle callbacks when we are done.

	Tue Mar 24 12:07:52 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

 	not running and we can't figure out which function we are in.

	* main.tcl (run_executable): Change to assembly mode when we try to
 	load a blank file.  This usually means that source level debugging
 	was not enabled when this file was compiled.
	
	Reverse the parameters to src method::location() method invocation so
	they are in the correct order

	Mon Mar 23 12:04:23 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* src.tcl (update): Comment out debug lines.

	breakpoints and should be "modified" calls. Detect this
	and pass the entry number to bp_delete or bp_modify.

	Fri Mar 20 22:50:55 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	question is actually asked.

        Keith Seitz  <keiths@onions.cygnus.com>
	* variables.tcl (deleteTree): Reset Locals and ChangeList, too.

        Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>
	* main.tcl (run_executable): Removed delete_breakpoints
	stuff.
	* download.tcl (download_it): Removed delete_breakpoints
	stuff.  Clear any breakpoints at exit and main before
	restarting.  They get set again automatically if the

	it stops updating when we do.
	(update): Renamed to update_download to avoid confusion.

        Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>
	* src.tcl (build_win): Set mode combobox width to 10.
	(goto_func): If a function name is an unmangled one,
	it is a C++ method so don't prepend filename when
	setting location.  This is a kludge, but we are limited
	by the symtax the GDB command line parser will accept.
	(location): When loading function combobox,
	remember which names are unmangled. Change width of
	function combobox dynamically to better accomodate
	those long C++ names.

        Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>
	* src.tcl (bp_line): When doing a "continue to here",
	first save states of all breakpoints then restore
	when finished.

        Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@cygnus.com>
	* main.tcl: (run_executable): Modified to call download_it
	with the parameter indicating whether to delete breakpoints.
	If GDB is loaded ($gdb_loaded == 1) and the app is running
	($gdb_app_running == 1) then we don't delete the breakpoints.
	All other situations will require deleting the breakpoints.
	This allows us to redownload and run the same executable w/o
	losing the breakpoint information.
	* download.tcl: (download_it): Modified this routine to
	take a boolean parameter indicating whether to delete
	the breakpoints before downloading.

        Sean Mahan  <smahan@cygnus.com>
	* toolbar.tcl (create_menu_items): Couldn't use 'helpdir'

	in parsing the stack line to get the correct PC.

        Keith Seitz  <keiths@onions.cygnus.com>
	* download.tcl (download_it): Run gdb_busy_hook's.
	If anything fails, make sure that the no_inferior_hook's are run.
	Note errors that occur during downloading, ignoring the
	"cancelled download" message. If an error occurs, set the
	global gdb_download_error to the error message so that it can
	be shown to the user later. Don't run the idle hooks if nothing
	* src.tcl (download_progress): Do not rely on the value of
	"download_cancel_ok" -- it is cleared in download_it.
	Reorder code to take advantage of gdb_loaded and gdb_download_error
	to determine if a download was canceled, successful, or failed due
	to an error. Truncate the "DOWNLOAD FINISHED:" message so that it
	will fit into the status bar given the recent font changes.
	(busy): If gdb_loaded, set the status bar to read "Program is running."
	Otherwise, don't touch it.
	(config_win): Comment out "Continue to here" right-click menu item
	until it can properly preserve breakpoint state.
	(no_inferior): Configure the toolbar to -runstop 0. All of these
	toolbar references should be done via the busy hook by the SrcBar
	class itself someday...

        Sean Mahan  <smahan@cygnus.com>

	the tour help file from the help menu.

	(build_win): Change name and function combobox heights to 0.
	Set status bar font to src-font.
	(name): Rewrite to use _files array.  This array allows us
	to map full pathnames with short names that are easily displayed.
	(file): Call set_name to update name combobox.
	(location): Call set_name to update name combobox. When setting
	the function combobox, adjust height to a maximum of 10. CLear
	filename combobox if there is no valid filename. When setting the
	filename combobox, adjust height to a maximum of 10. Create
	_files array mapping full pathnames to short names. For IDE, use
	vmake/source-files and project-root to build full pathnames.
	When changing mode, save current line. Don't mark current line
	with PC_TAG if gdb_running is 0.
	(set_name): New function. Update the name combobox, using
	the short name from _files if available.
	* bp.tcl (bp_modify, bp_add): Use short file name from
	_files global array.
