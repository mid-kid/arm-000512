/* If the user has switched threads, and there is a breakpoint
   at the old thread's pc location, then switch to that thread
   and return TRUE, else return FALSE and don't do a thread
   switch (or rather, don't seem to have done a thread switch).

   Ptrace-based gdb will always return FALSE to the thread-switch
   query, and thus also to PREPARE_TO_PROCEED.

   The important thing is whether there is a BPT instruction,
   not how many user breakpoints there are.  So we have to worry
   about things like these:

   o  Non-bp stop -- NO

   o  User hits bp, no switch -- NO

   o  User hits bp, switches threads -- YES

   o  User hits bp, deletes bp, switches threads -- NO

   o  User hits bp, deletes one of two or more bps
      at that PC, user switches threads -- YES

   o  Plus, since we're buffering events, the user may have hit a
      breakpoint, deleted the breakpoint and then gotten another
      hit on that same breakpoint on another thread which
      actually hit before the delete. (FIXME in breakpoint.c
      so that "dead" breakpoints are ignored?) -- NO

   For these reasons, we have to violate information hiding and
   call "breakpoint_here_p".  If core gdb thinks there is a bpt
   here, that's what counts, as core gdb is the one which is
   putting the BPT instruction in and taking it out. */
