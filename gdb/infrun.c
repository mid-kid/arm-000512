  /* The parent and child of a vfork share the same address space.
     Also, on some targets the order in which vfork and exec events
     are received for parent in child requires some delicate handling
     of the events.

     For instance, on ptrace-based HPUX we receive the child's vfork
     event first, at which time the parent has been suspended by the
     OS and is essentially untouchable until the child's exit or second
     exec event arrives.  At that time, the parent's vfork event is
     delivered to us, and that's when we see and decide how to follow
     the vfork.  But to get to that point, we must continue the child
     until it execs or exits.  To do that smoothly, all breakpoints
     must be removed from the child, in case there are any set between
     the vfork() and exec() calls.  But removing them from the child
     also removes them from the parent, due to the shared-address-space
     nature of a vfork'd parent and child.  On HPUX, therefore, we must
     take care to restore the bp's to the parent before we continue it.
     Else, it's likely that we may not stop in the expected place.  (The
     worst scenario is when the user tries to step over a vfork() call;
     the step-resume bp must be restored for the step to properly stop
     in the parent after the call completes!)

             The latter two can come in either order.
