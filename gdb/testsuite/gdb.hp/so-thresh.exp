#   - so-thresh.c
#   - 3 .c files named libXX-so-thresh.c
#   - a makefile named so-thresh.mk with a
#     target named "so-thresh" that will compile
#     and link the testcase
#
# Making with so-thresh.mk produces:
#   - so-thresh
#   - 3 shared libraries that are linked against, named
#     libXX-so-thresh.sl
#
# We build gen-so-thresh, run it, and then make with
# the makefile it produces.
